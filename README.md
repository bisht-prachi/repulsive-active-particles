# repulsive self-propelled particles
A model for anti-aligning self propelled particles. 
- The orientation update rule is asynchronous as opposed to the synchronous update rule implemented in traditional Vicsek model. 
* The particle orientation are **sequentially** updated in the first step in a random order. The average orientation of a particle's neighbourhood - defined as a circle of radius R centered around the particle - is evaluated and the said particle assumes an orientation = (average + pi). The *pi* terms effectuates a *repulsive* inter-particle interaction.
+ In the second step, all particles move simultaneously.
+ Third step, the particle order is shuffled randomly

The steady state picture:
  Two alternating lanes consisting of particle clusters, moving in opposite directions respectively.
